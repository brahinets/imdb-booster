# IMDB Booster

### Utilities to organise my IMDB library

- Rate titles (movies\series\etc) using dump of IMDB ratings, like export from another account, i.e. account merge
- Rate titles (movies\series\etc) using dump from other systems (Kinoposhuk), for migration from them
- Something more. Probably. Later.

### Run

- use `BoosterApplication` and do not forget to set `imdb_api_session_cookie_ubid_main`
  and `imdb_api_session_cookie_at_main` env variable for authorisation. `.env` file are supported now, just put in root
  project folder
